# How-to-create-active-and-inactive-alarms-and-send-notifications-to-the-customer-from-ThingsBoard

Working with IoT device alarms

ThingsBoard provides the ability to create and manage alarms related to our entities: devices, assets, customers, etc. 
For example, we may configure ThingsBoard to automatically create an alarm when the device will be switch on or switch off.

Type

Alarm type helps to identify the root cause of the alarm. For example, ‚ÄúDevice active‚Äù and ‚ÄúDevice inactive‚Äù are two different alarms.

Severity
Each alarm has severity which is either Critical, Major, Minor, Warning, or Indeterminate (sorted by priority in descending order).
  
How to visualize alarms on the dashboard?

See this doc to add an alarm widget to the dashboard.

We can also explore datasource settings and advanced settings of the widget.

The Datasource setting allows us to:

Specify the status filter using any combination of ack/unack/active/clear;
Specify severity filter using any combination of severity levels;
Specify a list of alarm types;
Enable or disable search of the propagated alarms (disabled by default).
